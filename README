Quick and Dirty functions for Wildlife simulations.

Over the years I've done various wildlife data simulations in R and have written little
 functions to estimate occupancy or abundance or survival directly in R, without having
 to export the data to PRESENCE or MARK or EstimateS.

We did a simulations workshop earlier in the year, so I put these together into a package.
