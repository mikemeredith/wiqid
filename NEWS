TODO

  * Change parameter in Bsecr0 from lam0 to g0; note limitations in help file; use
    secr::autoini to get starting values.

  * Ensure that trap losses can be coded with NA in the detection history in ch2marray,
      closedCap*, etc. Verify that NAs are preceded by 1 and continue to the end.

  * Improve survRD: choice of closedCap function, AIC

  * Implement predict for more models: occSScovSite, etc.

CHANGES in 0.1.2.9003 (2017-10-17)

  * New code for SEs of fitted values implemented for predict, closedCapMtcov, occ2sps, occMS, occMStime, occMScovSite, occSScovSite, occSSrnSite, occSStime, survCJS, survCJSaj.

  * Calls to 'stopifnot' changed to informative error messages.

  * Calls to 'cat' and 'print' replaced with 'message' where appropriate.

CHANGES in 0.1.2.9002 (2017-10-16)

  * Bug fix in BoccSS0: burnin iterations are now discarded.

  * Calculation of SEs of fitted values now uses less memory: implemented for occSS.

  * 'verify' checks detection histories for all-NA rows; all-NA rows removed from GrandSkinks data set.

CHANGES in 0.1.2.9001 (2017-10-08)

  * Better error message in plot.Bwiqid if 'which' is not character.

  * Spelling corrections in help pages.

CHANGES in 0.1.2.9000 (2017-09-21)

  * Sanity checks for Bnormal

CHANGES in 0.1.2 (2017-09-10)

  * Added diagPlot function and improved other diagnostic plots.

  * Added function Bpoisson; Bbinom renamed Bbinomial

CHANGES in 0.1.1 (2017-06-09)

  * Added 'coef', 'vcov' and 'predict' methods for 'wiqid' objects.

  * 'survCJS' gains an 'interval' argument to deal with time intervals of unequal length.

  * dots argument added to MLE functions to pass parameters to 'nlm'.

  * Improved coding of several functions to prevent under/overflow issues.
