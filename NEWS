TODO

  * deprecate Bbinom

  * scrap improper default priors for Bnormal, maybe do as original version of BEST

  * Improve Bsecr0...

  * should as.Bwiqid.Bwiqid recalculate diagnostics?

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9013 (2019-06-05)

  * 'testthat' tests updated for new (from 3.6.0) RNG for sample.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9012 (2019-06-03)

  * 'simpleRhat' returns NAs if only one chain, instead of throwing an error.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9011 (2019-05-20)

  * Fixed bug in 'diagPlot' when MCMC chain values not quite equal.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9010 (2019-05-05)

  * 'diagPlot' displays a 'main' title in the outer margin, returns nothing.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9009 (2019-05-04)

  * 'diagPlot' gains a 'chains' argument.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9008 (2019-05-01)

  * Fixed incorrect handling of class 'bugs' objects in 'diagPlot' and 'as.Bwiqid'.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9007 (2019-04-22)

  * a few typos fixed plus change to 'formula' call to satisfy R 3.7.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9006 (2019-04-20)

  * 'diagPlot' revamped; accepts a range of classes.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9005 (2019-04-19)

  * Tweaks to 'crosscorrPlot' to prevent silly warnings; 'which' argument replaced with 'params'.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9004 (2019-04-18)

  * 'crosscorrPlot' now accepts classes 'mcmc.list', 'jagsUI', 'bugs', 'rjags', 'runjags'.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9003 (2019-04-18)

  * 'as.Bwiqid' revamped; makes more effort to retain original Rhat and n.eff; parameter
    names conversion changed: a1[1,2] now becomes a1.1.2. instead of a11.2; original
    names retained as attribute 'BUGSnames'.


CHANGES in 0.2.1.9001

  * Changed 'diagPlot' display for integers to dynamite plot instead of histogram.

  * Separate means for each chain in 'diagPlot' density plots.

CHANGES in 0.2.1.9000

  * Added 'crosscorrPlot' function for 'Bwiqid' objects.

  * Changed 'diagPlot' display for integers to lollipop plot instead of histogram.

CHANGES in 0.2.1

  * 'diagPlot' no longer uses its own colour palette.

  * 'window.Bwiqid' now adds new diagnostics for Rhat and n.eff.

  * Rhat calculated with 'simpleRhat', n.eff with 'safeNeff' everywhere.

CHANGES in 0.2.0

  * Continuous covariates now standardised to mean=0, SD=1 (instead of SD=0.5).
    Default priors for 'BoccSS' and 'BsurvCJS' changed to match this.

  * Added 'standardize' and 'standardize2match' functions.

  * Added 'simpleRhat' and 'getMCerror' functions; used by 'as.Bwiqid'.

  * 'diagPlot' gains a 'howMany' argument to plot less than the whole chain.

  * 'as.Bwiqid.data.frame' gains arguments 'n.chains', 'Rhat' and 'n.eff' and is
    included in the help page.

  * If the variance-covariance matrix cannot be calculated, MLE functions
    now return the log(likelihood) but number of parameters, df = NA.

  * 'AICc' gains a 'df' argument which overrides the df value in the model
    object, so an AICc value can be got even if the covariance matrix cannot be
    calculated.

  * Added *beta2 and *gamma2, wrappers for *beta and *gamma with mean and sd
    parameters, and *beta3 with mode and concentration.

  * Added getBetaPar and getGammaPar to convert mean/sd parameters to shape/rate.

CHANGES in 0.1.5 (2018-04-20)

  * Fixed check for installation of package shiny in showShinyApp.

CHANGES in 0.1.4 (2018-04-20)

  * new function densityFolded, used in plotPost and plot.Bwiqid when showCurve=TRUE.

  * summary.Bwiqid method added, prints background and returns values invisibly.

  * diagPlot now displays n.eff

  * fix: in as.Bwiqid.mcmc.list, call to gelman.diag wrapped in try.

  * fix: histogram breaks in plotPost are equidistant (as always intended).

  * fix: the first argument to BoccSS0 can be a matrix or data frame with a detection history.

  * fix: occSSrn0 now accepts scalar n, as documented.

CHANGES in 0.1.3 (2017-11-18)

  * Calculation of SEs of fitted values now uses less memory, works for large data sets.

  * Functions more robust to underflow/overflow: closedCap*, occ2sps, occSS*

  * Changed parameterization in Bsecr0 from lam0 to g0; better default priors.

  * Bug fix in BoccSS0: burnin iterations are now discarded.

CHANGES in 0.1.2 (2017-09-10)

  * Added diagPlot function and improved other diagnostic plots.

  * Added function Bpoisson; Bbinom renamed Bbinomial

CHANGES in 0.1.1 (2017-06-09)

  * Added 'coef', 'vcov' and 'predict' methods for 'wiqid' objects.

  * 'survCJS' gains an 'interval' argument to deal with time intervals of unequal length.

  * dots argument added to MLE functions to pass parameters to 'nlm'.

  * Improved coding of several functions to prevent under/overflow issues.
