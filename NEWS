TODO

  * Check that SE is returned for betas, not for reals. Also all MLE functions should report var-covar matrix or NULL if Hessian cannot be inverted.
  
  * TRY using Gelman et al 2008 recommendations for priors for logistic coefficients. Update man page for priors. Also implement 0.5xSD scaling for all functions (not just Bayes).
  
  * Look at problem in occSSautocorA
  
  * Do test files for new functions
  
CHANGES IN 2014-01-30 v.0.0.364

  * expanded occMScov to take survey covariates; that is slow, as it calculates a different probability of detection for each site x occasion. So retianed the old function under the name occMScovSite.

CHANGES IN 2014-01-28 v.0.0.363

  * Changed occSSrn to take a detection history matrix as first argument.
  
  * fixed bugs in postPriorOverlap, survCJSaj.
  
  * added priorOnly argument to Bayesian functions (useful for postPriorOverlap),
  
  * Added .Time covar (for time trend) to survCJS

CHANGES IN 2014-01-26 v.0.0.362

  * Changed closedCap* functions so that all take a detection history matrix as first argument.

  * The hdi generic gets methods for classes bugs, rjags and runjags.
  
  * New function postPriorOverlap calculates and displays the overlap between posterior and prior.

CHANGES IN 2014-01-11 v.0.0.361

  * Multi-season occupancy functions (occMS*) tidied up to deal with sites with surveys in first season only.
  
  * Fixed bug in Bsecr0 - prior for sigma was too constrained.
 
  * Changed survival functions to use ordinary detection history matrix instead of m-array; conversion to m-array is done internally.
  
  * Added dippers data set.
  
  * Functions occSS.t, occSS.T and occSS.T2 replaced with a single function, occSStime, which can also accept time-varying covariates for probability of detection.
 
CHANGES IN 2014-01-05

  * Version number system changed as CRAN doesn't like leading zeros. Version 0.0359 followed by version 0.0.360. 
  
CHANGES IN 2013-12-24

  * wiqid-package man page gives a list of all functions by type, with links to man pages.

  * Functions cjsTime and BcjsTime renamed as survCJS and BsurvCJS.
  
  * New function survCJSaj for data sets for adults and juveniles, eg sociable lapwings.
  
  * New class 'wiqid' replaces classes 'occupancy' and 'closedCap' and is used for survCJS output.
  
CHANGES IN 2013-12-16

  * New functions occMSseason and occMScov do covariate versions of multiple season occupancy.
  
CHANGES IN 2013-12-14

  * New function Bsecr0 does Bayesian version of simple secr fit.

  * New function occMS0 does simple multi-season analysis.

  * New function BcjsTime does Bayesian version of survival.

  * cjs0 removed; use cjsTime for phi(.) p(.) model
  
  * Argument 'model' now used in occSScov and occSScovSite.
  
  * Covariate data for occSScovSite now a data frame, not a list.
  
  * New function occSS.T2 does quadratic model for probabilitiy of detection. occSS.T and occSS.T2 do a plot of p vs time.
  
  * New function BoccSS0 does Bayesian modelling with JAGS.
  
  * new function occSSautocorA does autocorrelation in detection probability.

  * occSScovSite was throwing error if variables not in the model contained NAs.
  TODO check other functions are not doing this too!
  
  * added .Time and .Time2 built-in covars to occSScov
  
  * added AICtable utility function.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-11-04

  * closedCap* functions now return an object of class closedCap, for which there are print, logLik and nobs methods.

  * added ciType argument to closedCap* functions. ciType = "MARK" calculates CI for N as in Program MARK. Test files modified to match.
  
  * add closedCapMt and closedCapMtcov

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-10-04

  * Changed sanity checks in closedCapM0 and closedCapsMhJK to allow just 1 recapture.
    Test files modified to match.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-04-07

 * Fixed occSSrn to produce NAs if input is all ones; changed test file to match.

 * Changed checks for solving hessian in closedCapM0, Mh2; increased interlim for mle in closedCapM0.

 * Changes to test files for closedCap*, as R 3.0.0 was not giving exactly the same answer; round(...,4) changed to signif(..., 4).

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-31

  * Removed distWhittackerI, which is same as distSorensen; renamed distWhittackerA
 as just distWhittacker.

  * add ci=0.95 argument to all functions that return a confidence interval.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-30

  * Added richJackA1, richJackA2, richRenLau, and Temburong data set.

  * Added biodSimpson, biodShannon, biodBerger, biodBrillouin.

  * richSobs et al now accept vector input when appropriate.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-24

  * Extra sanity checks added to occSS0, occSSrn, occSScovSite.

  * occSSrn returns an object of class 'occupancy'.

  * Took out bird_mass from KillarneyBirds data set.

  * Changed spelling of *Rarify to *Rarefy (Oxford Dictionary online says both are correct but rarefy is more common).

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-19

  * Tweaked occSScovar and occSScovarSite to accept formulae as character variables, also to return logLik = NA if convergence problems.

  * occSScovar was throwing error if no survey covars were provided.

  * Tweaked occSS.T to prevent warnings due to 'nll' returning Inf.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-19

  * Tweaked occSScovar and occSScovarSite to improve convergence and catch variance estimation problems. Covars internally standardised, so betas are different.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-18

  * Added allCombinations function.

  * Added logLik and nobs methods for class occupancy; modified occSS* functions to accommodate that. Function stats::AIC now works for occupancy.

  * Added AICc generic and AICc.default.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-16

  * Added distance (beta diversity) measures

  * Added species richness estimation as in EstimateS
