CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-04-07

 * Fixed occSSrn to produce NAs if input is all ones; changed test file to match.

 * Changed checks for solving hessian in closedCapM0, Mh2; increased interlim for mle in closedCapM0.

 * Changes to test files for closedCap*, as R 3.0.0 was not giving exactly the same answer; round(...,4) changed to signif(..., 4).

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-31

  * Removed distWhittackerI, which is same as distSorensen; renamed distWhittackerA
 as just distWhittacker.

  * add ci=0.95 argument to all functions that return a confidence interval.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-30

  * Added richJackA1, richJackA2, richRenLau, and Temburong data set.

  * Added biodSimpson, biodShannon, biodBerger, biodBrillouin.

  * richSobs et al now accept vector input when appropriate.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-24

  * Extra sanity checks added to occSS0, occSSrn, occSScovSite.

  * occSSrn returns an object of class 'occupancy'.

  * Took out bird_mass from KillarneyBirds data set.

  * Changed spelling of *Rarify to *Rarefy (Oxford Dictionary online says both are correct but rarefy is more common).

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-19

  * Tweaked occSScovar and occSScovarSite to accept formulae as character variables, also to return logLik = NA if convergence problems.

  * occSScovar was throwing error if no survey covars were provided.

  * Tweaked occSS.T to prevent warnings due to 'nll' returning Inf.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-19

  * Tweaked occSScovar and occSScovarSite to improve convergence and catch variance estimation problems. Covars internally standardised, so betas are different.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-18

  * Added allCombinations function.

  * Added logLik and nobs methods for class occupancy; modified occSS* functions to accommodate that. Function stats::AIC now works for occupancy.

  * Added AICc generic and AICc.default.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-16

  * Added distance (beta diversity) measures

  * Added species richness estimation as in EstimateS
