CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-24

  * Extra sanity checks added to occSS0, occSSrn, occSScovSite.

  * occSSrn returns an object of class 'occupancy'.

  * Took out bird_mass from KillarneyBirds data set.

  * Changed spelling of *Rarify to *Rarefy (Oxford Dictionary online says both are correct but rarefy is more common).

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-19

  * Tweaked occSScovar and occSScovarSite to accept formulae as character variables, also to return logLik = NA if convergence problems.

  * occSScovar was throwing error if no survey covars were provided.

  * Tweaked occSS.T to prevent warnings due to 'nll' returning Inf.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-19

  * Tweaked occSScovar and occSScovarSite to improve convergence and catch variance estimation problems. Covars internally standardised, so betas are different.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-18

  * Added allCombinations function.

  * Added logLik and nobs methods for class occupancy; modified occSS* functions to accommodate that. Function stats::AIC now works for occupancy.

  * Added AICc generic and AICc.default.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-16

  * Added distance (beta diversity) measures

  * Added species richness estimation as in EstimateS
