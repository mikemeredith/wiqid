\title{
Multi-season detection data for grand skinks
}
\description{
Results of an occupancy survey of 352 rocky outcrops ("tors") looking for grand skinks. Tors were surveyed up to 3 times per year for 5 years. The surrounding terrain was characterised as natural grassland or pasture.

\usage{data(GrandSkinks)}
\format{

  \describe{
    \item{\code{A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, D3, E1, E2, E3}}{an array of observations of detection (1) or nondetection (0) of skinks for each of 3 occasions in 5 years. NA indicates occasions when a tor was not visited. }
    \item{\code{habitat}}{a factor indicating the type of grassland surrounding the tor.}
  }
