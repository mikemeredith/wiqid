\title{
Multi-season occupancy estimation
}
\description{
Functions to estimate occupancy from detection/non-detection data for multiple seasons. \code{occMS} is the general purpose function; it allows for site-, season- and survey-level covariates, but it is slow. \code{occMScovSite} excludes survey-level covariates, but is fast. \code{occMStime} and \code{occMS0} are simpler and faster.
}
\usage{
occMS0(DH, occsPerSeason, ci=0.95)

occMStime(DH, occsPerSeason, model=NULL, data=NULL, ci=0.95)

occMS(DH, occsPerSeason, model=NULL, data=NULL, ci=0.95)
             
occMScovSite(DH, occsPerSeason, model=NULL, data=NULL, ci=0.95)
}
\arguments{
 \item{DH}{
a 1/0/NA matrix (or data frame) of detection histories, sites x occasions
}
  \item{occsPerSeason}{
the number of survey occasions per season; either a scalar if the number of surveys is constant, or a vector with one element for each season.
}
  \item{model}{
a list of formulae symbolically defining a linear predictor for each parameter in terms of covariates. The default corresponds to an intercept-only model.
}
  \item{data}{
a data frame containing the variables in the model: one row for each season or between-season period for \code{occMStime} and one for each site for \code{occMScovSite}. Each survey covariate has one column for each occasion, and the column name must end with the occasion number (without leading zeros); eg, \code{Cov1, Cov2, ..., Cov15}.
}
  \item{ci}{
the confidence interval to use.
}
}
\details{
\code{occMS0} implements a simple multi-season model with one parameter each for initial occupancy, colonisation, local extinction, and probability of detection, ie. a \code{psi1(.) gamma(.) epsilon(.) p(.)} model.

\code{occMStime} allows for between-season differences in colonisation, local extinction, and probability of detection, either with covariates given in \code{data} or the in-built covariates \code{.interval} (for colonisation or extinction, or \code{.season} (for detection).

\code{occMScovSite} allows for between-season differences in colonisation, local extinction, and probability of detection with the in-built covariate \code{.season} and for between-site differences with covariates defined in \code{data}.

\code{occMS} allows for survey-level covariates in addition to the above, and separate covariates for between-season colonisation and local extinction.
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{wiqid}, which is a list with the following elements:

  \item{call}{The call used to produce the results}
  \item{beta}{Values of the coefficients of the terms in the linear predictors, with standard errors and confidence intervals.}
  \item{beta.vcv }{The variance-covariance matrix for the beta estimates.}
  \item{real}{Estimates of occupancy and probability of detection on the real scale, with confidence intervals; \code{occSSrn} gives occupancy, lambda and r.}
  \item{logLik}{a vector with elements for log(likelihood), number of parameters, and effective sample size. If parameters \emph{and their SEs} cannot be estimated, the first element should be \code{NA}.}

There are \code{print}, \code{logLik}, and \code{nobs} methods for class \code{wiqid}.

\section{Benchmarks}{Output has been checked against output from PRESENCE (Hines 2006) v.5.5 for the \code{\link{GrandSkinks}} data set. Real values are mostly the same to 4 decimal places, though there is occasionally a discrepancy of 0.0001. AICs are the same.
