\title{
Sample-based rarefaction curves
}
\description{
Uses Mao's tau estimator (Colwell et al, 2004) to obtain a rarefaction curve indicating the expected number of species observed if fewer samples were collected.
}
\usage{
richRarefy(incmat)
}
\arguments{
  \item{incmat}{
a 1/0 matrix of species incidence (presence), species x sites. A matrix of counts may also be provided.
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
A matrix with columns for the estimate and its standard deviation and rows for the number of samples pooled. Confidence limits may be obtained with estimate +/- 1.96 * SD.
