\title{
Royle-Nichols model for single-season occupancy estimation
}
\description{
These functions implement the Royle-Nichols method (Royle & Nichols 2003) for estimation of site occupancy allowing for abundance-induced heterogeneity in detection probability. Probability of detection is modelled as a function of the number of animals available for detection, \emph{n}, and the probability of detection of an individual animal, \emph{r}. Probability of occupancy is derived as the probability that \emph{n} > 0.

Function \code{occSSrnSite} allows for site-specific covariates to be included in the model.

}
\usage{

occSSrn(DH, model=NULL, data = NULL, ci=0.95)

occSSrnSite(y, n, model=NULL, data = NULL, ci=0.95)

}
\arguments{
 \item{DH}{
a 1/0/NA matrix (or data frame) of detection histories, sites x occasions.
}
  \item{model}{
a list of formulae symbolically defining a linear predictor for each parameter in terms of covariates. If NULL, an intercept-only model is used, ie, lambda(.) r(.).
}
  \item{data}{
a data frame containing the variables in the model, with a row for each site. Each site covariate has one column. Each survey covariate has one column for each occasion, and the column name must end with the occasion number (without leading zeros); eg, \code{Cov1, Cov2, ..., Cov15}. All covariates should be included in \code{data}, otherwise they will be sought in enclosing environments, which may not produce what you want -- and they won't be standardised.

Note: currently only site covariates can be handled.
}
  \item{ci}{
the confidence interval to use.
}

  \item{y}{
a vector with the number of detections at each site.
}
  \item{n}{
a scalar or vector with the number of visits (survey occasions) at each site.
}

}
\details{

Numeric covariates in \code{data} are standardised to facilitate convergence. This applies to binary covariates coded as 1/0; if this is not what you want, code these as TRUE/FALSE or as factors. 

}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{wiqid}, which is a list with the following elements:

  \item{call}{The call used to produce the results}
  \item{beta}{Values of the coefficients of the terms in the linear predictors, with standard errors and confidence intervals.}
  \item{beta.vcv }{The variance-covariance matrix for the beta estimates.}
  \item{real}{Estimates of occupancy, lambda and r on the real scale, with confidence intervals.}
  \item{logLik}{a vector with elements for log(likelihood), number of parameters, and effective sample size. If parameters \emph{and their SEs} cannot be estimated, the first element should be \code{NA}.}

There are \code{print}, \code{logLik}, and \code{nobs} methods for class \code{wiqid}.

\section{Benchmarks}{Output has been checked against output from PRESENCE (Hines 2006) v.6.9 for the \code{\link{weta}} data set. Real values are mostly the same to 4 decimal places, though there is occasionally a discrepancy of 0.001. AICs are the same.
